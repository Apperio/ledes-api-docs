  tx_id:
    type: string
    description: |
      A unique identifier associated with the tax/rate/jurisdiction, assigned by the law firm.
    example: T1234556
  tx_id_number:
    type: string
    description: |
      Tax ID Number for law firm or vendor associated with specific tax.
    example: US1234
  tax_type:
    type: string
    description: |
      Type of tax.  Based on a value specified by the client.
      Examples in US: "Federal", "State", "Local".
      Examples in Canada: "GST", "HST", "PST", "TVQ".
    example: PST
  tax_tiers:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      "tax_tiers" = true only where there are different tax rates applicable to billed tiers.   
      If Tiered Tax is true, the LEDES invoice should contain only one matter;
      multiple matters/invoice are not allowed for Tiered Taxes.
  tax_rate_percent:
    type: number
    example: 0.20
    description: |
      Percentage tax rate against charge, i.e. 7.2516% tax_rate_percent would be
      represented as "0.072516". The value in this field is always positive.  In some
      countries, tax could be a negative number (for example, Brazil has a negative
      withholding tax), in which case @TAX.increase_decrease = Decrease.
      If a Tiered Tax, the value in this field should be null.  The tax rates
      associated with a Tiered Tax are defined in the @TAX_TIER_DETAIL segment.
  taxing_jurisdiction_country:
    $ref: '../common_fields/country.yaml'
  taxing_jurisdiction_locality:
    type: string
    example: ON
    description: |
      The locality of the taxing jurisdiction.  Use accepted abbreviations for state or
      province mandated by the country's postal service.  For Canadian PST,
      taxing_jurisdiction_locality for Ontario would be "ON"; for Local tax in New York
      City, taxing_jurisdiction_locality would be "New York, NY"; for state tax in
      Georgia (USA), taxing_jurisdiction_locality would be "GA"; for VAT tax in France,
      taxing_jurisdiction_locality would be null.
  tax_on_tax:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      "Tax-on-Tax" is a situation where one or more taxes in a tax jurisdiction are based
      on the sum of the corresponding invoice line item totals AND any other tax amount
      previously applied to those line item totals. For example, formerly n both Quebec and
      Prince Edward Island Canada had specific taxes calculated on the sum of the line
      items plus the federal tax paid on those line items.
  tax_on_tax_id:
    type: string
    example: tx123456
    description: |
      In a "tax-on-tax" situation (described above), the tax_on_tax_id is the tx_id of the
      tax that should be included in the tax calculation for the current tx_id.  For
      example, in Canada the TVQ tax includes not only the line items taxed, but also the
      GST tax for these line items.  The proper response to this tax_on_tax_id field would
      be the tx_id for the GST tax. Although we are currently not aware of any such
      situation, it may be the case in a jurisdiction that there is a tax-on-tax-on-tax
      situation.  It is anticipated that this field would hierarchically grow as necessary.
      Using the example in the previous paragraph, say that tax3 includes TVQ and GST taxes.
      Since the TVQ tax already shows the hierarchical relationship with GST in the
      tax_on_tax_id field, tax 3 would list the tx_id for TVQ in this tax_on_tax_id field.
  is_increase:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Identifies whether the tax results in increasing or decreasing the matter/invoice.
      Almost all taxes are "Increase", the exception being Withholding Tax.
      Withholding Tax is tax that is paid by the client to the government as opposed to
      being collected by the firm and paid to the government.
      While taxes are itemized against individual line items on the bill, Withholding
      Taxes are calculated against total of fees and total of disbursements charged pre-tax
      and post split on the invoice.  Individual line items will not associate with the
      @TAX.tx_id for withholding taxes. There can be more than one Withholding Tax on an
      invoice, but each Withholding Tax would have a different tax rate percentage.
      The total of the Withholding Tax(es) do not have to equal to the other taxes on the
      invoice; they could be less than or greater than the total of the other taxes
      charged on the invoice.
