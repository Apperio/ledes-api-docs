  The Client and their invoices
required:
  - cl_lf_id
  - cl_name
  - cl_address
properties:
  cl_id:
    type: string
    description: The law firm assigned client code.
    example: CLI12345
  cl_lf_id:
    type: string
    description: |
      A vendor ID that uniquely identifies the law firm, as specified by the client.
      Could be the law firm's tax id number or other value used by the client to uniquely
      identify the law firm.
      Values required in this field may vary from client to client, but within a client's
      e-billing implementation only one such unique ID is allowed per law firm.
      Some client AP systems maintain multiple vendor IDs for a law firm that could be,
      for example, location dependent.  It is not intended that multiple lf_vendor_ids for
      the same law firm would be supported by this field as they would be impossible to
      program into the law firm's time and billing software.  Clients must choose only one
      unique identifier per law firm to be used in this field.  
    example: CLI12345
  cl_name:
    type: string
    description: |
      The name of the client as required by the client in the electronic submission.
      Used as a key by the receiving system.  
    example: Acme Corp
  cl_address:
    $ref: '../common/address.yaml'
  client_contact:
    $ref: '../common/contact.yaml'
  cl_tax_id:
    type: string
    description: The client's tax id number to which law firm taxes are charged.
  extend_header:
    type: array
