    This is an illustration of how the OpenAPI specification could be used to
    document the LEDES API for the [ledes.org](https://ledes.org/ledes-api/).

    It is not complete and field names and enum values have been changed to
    conform to a different lettercase convention (rather than CamelCase).


    The public github repo for this site is available on
    [https://github.com/Apperio/ledes-api-docs](https://github.com/Apperio/ledes-api-docs)
    where you 

    can see the
    [yaml](https://github.com/Apperio/ledes-api-docs/blob/master/openapi.yml)
    file that was used to generate this page.


    The paths defined in the this URL must be relative to a base URL that
    contains a unique discriminator for that business, within what could
    potentially be

    a multitenant solution.


    # Security

    Security is paramount in the solution since legal invoices can contain
    highly private

    information. For example, the invoice line item descriptions and matter
    names can

    contain highly sensitive information. A comprehensive security structure is
    highly

    recommended, however, the LEDES API standard requires common security
    measures.

    Transmission encryption and session authentication are required, with
    recommended

    levels.  Content encryption is also highly recommended to address additional

    vulnerabilities in the management of sensitive data.  These security
    recommendations in

    general will need to be re-evaluated on a regular basis.


    ## Transmission Encryption Security

    All data should be encrypted in transit including authentication credentials
    (passwords),

    API keys, or JSON Web Tokens. This is needed to allow users to authenticate
    with the

    service and protects the integrity of the transmitted data.


    This first level of security can be achieved with HTTPS (TLS) and the use of
    mutually

    authenticated client-side certificates to provide additional protection for
    the LEDES

    API standard.  If implemented, client certificates will need to be managed
    between the

    law firm (sending system) and e-billing vendor (receiving system) by having
    certificates

    built from special 'roots'.


    *Minimum Requirement:*  HTTPS (TLS 1.1+)


    *Recommendation:* Client Certificates


    *Implementation:* Vendor application (all vendors)


    *User:* no action required


    ## Session Authentication Security

    Once transmission is secure, interaction with the user must be addressed.

    This can be addressed by employing a secure authentication and session
    management

    mechanism. User authorization for resources and data must be orchestrated
    through

    multiple vulnerability points, such as access permissions, session duration,
    and global

    logout.


    The widely adopted protocols for authentication and session management today
    are

    OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.  OAuth 2.0 introduces an authorization layer
    and separates

    the web client from the sensitive system resources.  The user is issued
    unique

    credentials, which protects the credentials used to manage these resources.

    OpenID Connect works with OAuth 2.0 to add an identity layer on top of the
    authentication

    layer, so more sophisticated permissions can be orchestrated in the
    application. 


    Requirements and recommendations are listed as “or equivalent” in
    recognition of

    multiple Identity Providers a vendor may subscribe to in order to offer
    appropriate

    authentication security.  Popular Identity Providers include Amazon, Google,
    and

    Microsoft, however no provider is endorsed or recommended here.


    *Minimum Requirement:* OAuth 2.0 (or equivalent)


    *Recommendation:* Open ID (or equivalent)


    *Implementation:* Vendor applications and system (or service) integration


    *User:* one-time authorization set up


    ## Content Encryption Security

    All invoice and related data should be encrypted while in use and at rest. 
    This is the

    final measure recommended to provide adequate security through the full life
    cycle of

    the data and application.

    There are multiple methods to provide content encryption and it is highly
    recommended

    that any new implementation decisions are part of a comprehensive analysis
    of current

    application and system integration vulnerabilities between vendors and with
    their end

    users. The current specification for encryption established by the U.S.
    National

    Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) and adopted globally is
    Advanced

    Encryption Standard (AES).  This is a symmetric key approach, with accepted
    key lengths

    of 128, 192, and 256 bits.  Recent successful attacks on 128 bit keys
    suggest it is

    appropriate to consider the use of longer keys.


    The API allows for the content to be optionally encrypted before it is
    transmitted,

    however it is not required. It is highly recommended that eBilling vendor
    support

    content encryption, however not all time and billing systems may support it.
    Below are

    the requirements for when the content is encrypted.


    *Minimum Requirement:* AES-256 (or equivalent) if content encryption is
    used.


    *Implementation:* Vendor applications and system integration


    *User:* one-time authorization set up

                                e-billing implementation only one such unique ID
                                is allowed per law firm.

                                Some client AP systems maintain multiple vendor
                                IDs for a law firm that could be,

                                for example, location dependent.  It is not
                                intended that multiple lf_vendor_ids for

                                the same law firm would be supported by this
                                field as they would be impossible to

                                program into the law firm's time and billing
                                software.  Clients must choose only one

                                unique identifier per law firm to be used in
                                this field.

It is anticipated that this field would hierarchically grow as necessary.\nUsing the example in the previous paragraph, say that tax3 includes TVQ and GST taxes.\nSince the TVQ tax already shows the hierarchical relationship with GST in the\ntax_on_tax_id field, tax 3 would list the tx_id for TVQ in this tax_on_tax_id field.\n"

                          Almost all taxes are "Increase", the exception being
                          Withholding Tax.

                          Withholding Tax is tax that is paid by the client to
                          the government as opposed to

                          being collected by the firm and paid to the
                          government.

                          While taxes are itemized against individual line items
                          on the bill, Withholding

                          Taxes are calculated against total of fees and total
                          of disbursements charged pre-tax

                          and post split on the invoice.  Individual line items
                          will not associate with the

                          @TAX.tx_id for withholding taxes. There can be more
                          than one Withholding Tax on an

                          invoice, but each Withholding Tax would have a
                          different tax rate percentage.

                          The total of the Withholding Tax(es) do not have to
                          equal to the other taxes on the

                          invoice; they could be less than or greater than the
                          total of the other taxes

                          charged on the invoice.
